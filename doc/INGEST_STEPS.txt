Receive Artesia UOIS XML export and media-to-be-uploaded from the MLA deptfs folder OpenVault_Uploads

Upload media files to splat:/wgbh/http/streaming/htdocs. Note the type-specific folders, e.g.:

    ./audio
    ./images
    ./thumbnails
    ./videos

Ensure the media files are chmod 664 (or better). (n.b. Files scp'ed from the deptfs may be chmod 700)

Upload the Artesia export to splat.

In /wgbh/http/openvault/blacklight-app:

Run the `rake openvault:ingest` to process the Artesia export into Open Vault-style Fedora objects (and index the objects into solr), e.g.:
    
    RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake openvault:ingest file=/home/cbeer/barcode24136_clip1.xml collection=org.wgbh.mla:ntw

This will ingest all the objects from the file barcode24136_clip1.xml (except those with WGBH_RIGHTS statements that forbid uploading to Open Vault), and add the objects to the org.wgbh.mla:ntw collection.

./lib/tasks/openvault.rake
./lib/openvault/digital_objects/artesia/assetproperties.rb

Artesia objects will be assigned Fedora PIDs (based on existing unique identifiers: NOLA codes, source reference numbers, etc, or the Artesia UOI_ID), and will replace existing records on Open Vault with that shared PID (or, UOI_ID).


After ingesting, we also need to update the media rewrite map, e.g.

    RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake openvault:rewrite > fedora_data_rewrite_map.20120227.txt

    /usr/sbin/httxt2dbm -i fedora_data_rewrite_map.20120227.txt -o fedora_data_rewrite_map.dbm
